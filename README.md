# Technology_Time_and_Your_Mental_Health_Summative
As the summative for my Scientific Data Analysis course, I created a Jupyter Notebook analyzing the relation between one's screen time on technology, and one's mental health.
This document uses NumPy and pandas to draw conclusions from the data's trends, and to create visuals based on gathered data.
Data in this document is external, and is used in CSV format.
